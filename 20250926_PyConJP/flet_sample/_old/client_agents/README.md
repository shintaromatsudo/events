# Hello Agent - Flet Version

A simple demo showing how to create AI agents using OpenAI API in Flet, inspired by the [wasm-agents-blueprint](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/wasm-agents-blueprint) project.

## Features

- ü§ñ Chat with OpenAI GPT models
- üé≠ Customizable agent behavior with instructions
- üöÄ Easy-to-use Flet UI
- üí° Example prompts and instructions
- üîê Secure API key management

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Configure OpenAI API Key:**

   Copy the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   ```

   You can get your API key from: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   uv run flet run src/main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Configure**: Set your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file
2. **Initialize**: Click "Initialize OpenAI Client" to set up the connection
3. **Customize**: Choose from example prompts and instructions, or create your own
4. **Run**: Click "Run Agent" to send your prompt and see the AI response

## Example Use Cases

- **Haiku Bot**: Get responses in traditional Japanese haiku format
- **Code Helper**: Get programming assistance with code examples
- **Pirate Assistant**: Have fun conversations with a pirate-themed AI
- **Philosopher**: Get deep, metaphorical responses to your questions
